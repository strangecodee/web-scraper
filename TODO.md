# Indentation Fix Plan

## Steps to Complete:
1. [x] Fix indentation of `process_links` method to be properly inside `DueAmountScraper` class
2. [x] Fix indentation of `main()` function to be at module level
3. [x] Fix inconsistent indentation within methods
4. [x] Verify all code follows proper Python indentation (4 spaces per level)
5. [x] Test that code still runs correctly

## Progress:
- [x] Step 1: Fix `process_links` method indentation
- [x] Step 2: Fix `main()` function indentation  
- [x] Step 3: Fix inconsistent indentation within methods
- [x] Step 4: Verify overall indentation
- [x] Step 5: Test functionality

## Status:
All major indentation issues have been fixed. The code should now be properly structured with:
- `process_links` method correctly indented within the `DueAmountScraper` class
- `main()` function at the module level
- Consistent 4-space indentation throughout
